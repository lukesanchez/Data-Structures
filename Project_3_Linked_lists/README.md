### Project 3 - Linked list ###
Project 3 implements stacks and queues of Country objects using Linked list. 153 Countries are parsed from a CSV file, and then are ingested into a stack of Country objects. Once every country is pushed onto the stack, each Country object is popped one by one and inserted in the queue.
