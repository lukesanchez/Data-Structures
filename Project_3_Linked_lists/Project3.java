/**
* COP 3530: Project 3 â€“ Linked lists
*<p> 
* The Project3 class ingest data from a given CSV file. 
* The program first creates a stack that is implemented from a Linked List. 
* It then parses the CSV file to extract Country objects, and inserts them into the stack one by one. 
* The Stack of Country objects is then printed from top to bottom. 
* A queue is then created, which also is implemented from a Linked List. 
* Items are then popped from the stack, one at a time, and inserted into the queue. 
* The Countries are inserted alternately to the Front and End of the queue, until the the stack is empty. 
* The Queue is then printed from the front to end. 
* Next the intervalDelete method is called to remove countries that are within the given interval.   
* The Queue is then reprinted to show all of the countries, but those that were deleted. 
* Next, each country is removed from the queue one by one from the queue and pushed to the original stack
* The Countries are removed by alternating between removing from the front and end of the queue. 
* Finally the stack is printed one more time from top to bottom. 
*  <p>
