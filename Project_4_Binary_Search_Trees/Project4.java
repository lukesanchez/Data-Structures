/**
 * COP 3530: Project 4 â€“ Binary Search Trees
 * <p>
 * This Project4 class contains two methods main() and parseCSV().
 * In the main() method, a BinarySearchTree(BST) is created.
 * That BST is then passed into the parseCSV() to ingest data from a CSV file.
 * Once the data is added to the BST, the entire tree is printed in Order.
 * Then some Country nodes are deleted from BST and then the BST is printed Preorder.
 * After that, the find method is used to find Four Country nodes.
 * Five more Country nodes are then deleted using the delete method.
 * Finally the print postOrder() method is used to print the BST in post order.
 * <p>
