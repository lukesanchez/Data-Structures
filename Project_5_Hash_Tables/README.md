### Project 5 - Hash Tables ###

Project 5 implements a Hash Table made up of County nodes. The 153 Countries, with related data, are parsed from a CSV file and are added to the table. The Country nodes are inserted into the hash table at a certain index based on the hash function. The HashTable class implements separate chaining using linked list to deal with collisions. The HashTable class also has a method to check the number of collisions and empty spaces in the generated hash table.
